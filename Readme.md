This generator aim to create NPC in relation with their settings to help DM create interesting encounters and make the world more belivable. The generator will allow to add custom cultures, cities, names and gods to adapt to any settings including homebrew ones.

## disclaimer !

## How to use ?

The generator ask for a little setup. You need to generate new cultures and places where the NPc could originate from.
